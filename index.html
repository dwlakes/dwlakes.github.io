            <p>
                I was heavily involved in music during high school. After graduating from high school in 2015, I studied music for a semester at Ball State University. However, burned out and not sure what to do with my life, I switched schools to Ivy Tech and my studies to social work. 
                It wouldn't be until 2023 when I decided to play music again. I decided to give writing music a shot and have been working on two pieces on and off. One Bossa Nova inspired, and another Flamenco inspired.
